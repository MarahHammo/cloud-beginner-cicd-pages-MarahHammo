    <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
    <p>
        CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
        It is a cloud development practice that automates testing and deployment.
        When developers push code to the repository, automated pipelines run checks and validation.
        If everything passes successfully, the system automatically deploys the updated version.
        CI/CD is important in cloud systems because it reduces human errors and speeds up delivery.

    <h2>My Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
        When I push code to the main branch, GitHub Actions starts automatically.
        It checks that required files exist in the repository.
        If the checks pass, the workflow uploads the website files.
        Finally, the site is deployed automatically to GitHub Pages.
