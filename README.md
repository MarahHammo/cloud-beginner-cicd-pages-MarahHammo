## Student Information

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the concept of CI/CD using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

Continuous Integration (CI) automatically checks the project files when code is pushed to the main branch.
Continuous Deployment (CD) automatically deploys the website after successful checks.
This ensures fast, reliable, and automated updates in cloud systems.

## My Pipeline Explanation
When I push code to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically starts.
It checks that required files (index.html, style.css, script.js) exist.
If all checks pass, the workflow uploads the website files.
Finally, the site is deployed automatically to GitHub Pages.

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.


## Live Website
I will add it after deployment.
